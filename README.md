## Description

**Craftcost** is a Minecraft Paper plugin designed to calculate exactly what materials you need to craft any item — whether it's a simple stick or a complex redstone contraption. Just run a command, specify the item and quantity, and choose between a normal breakdown of direct ingredients or a full recursive trace back to the base materials. Whether you're planning a megabase build or optimizing a survival run, Craftcost gives you clarity, precision, and control over your crafting needs.

## Features

### 🎯 Accurate Quantity Calculation
Automatically scales all crafting components based on the number of items you want to produce — including multi-output recipes.
> Next versions will include this

### 🧠 Recipe Tree Parsing
In recursive mode, Craftcost traverses all sub-recipes to determine the exact resource origin of every component.
